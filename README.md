# fivem-greenscreener
A small script that allows you to take screenshots of every gta clothing infront of a greenscreen.
You can use them for example in your inventory or a clothing shop.

## Planned
- Find a better way for editing the images

## Installation
**Dependencies**
- [screenshot-basic](https://github.com/citizenfx/screenshot-basic)
- yarn

### Step 1
Rename the resource from "fivem-greenscreener-main" to "fivem-greenscreener" and put it into your main resources folder.

**Don't use a subfolder like** `resources/[scripts]` **otherwise the script won't work**

## Usage
**Turn off your weather and time script.**
Use the command `/screenshot` and the process will start.
It will take some time and better don't touch your pc while the script runs.
