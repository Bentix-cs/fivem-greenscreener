# fivem-greenscreener
A small script that allows you to take screenshots of every gta clothing infront of a greenscreen.
You can use them for example in your inventory or a clothing shop.

Idea and greenscreen map from this [repository](https://github.com/Stuyk/altv-greenscreener).

If you want to support me use [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/bentix)❤️​.

## Features
- Take screenshots of every gta clothing
- Comprehensible naming of the screenshots for implementing it in your scripts

## Installation
**Dependencies**
- [screenshot-basic](https://github.com/citizenfx/screenshot-basic)
- yarn

### Step 1
Rename the resource from "main-fivem-greenscreener" to "fivem-greenscreener" and put it into your main resources folder.

**Don't use a subfolder like** `resources/[scripts]` **otherwise the script won't work**

## Usage
**Turn off your weather and time script.**
Use the command `/screenshot` and the process will start.
It will take some time and better don't touch your pc while the script runs.

## Editing the images
Personally I use [XnConvert](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnconvert/) for converting images to a .webp format and removing the greenscreen.

If you have any better soulution for editing let me know.
