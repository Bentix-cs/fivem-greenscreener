# fivem-greenscreener
A small script that allows you to take screenshots of every gta clothing or prop infront of a greenscreen.
You can use them for example in your inventory or a clothing shop.

You are **not** allowed to **sell** images generated by that script or even include this repo in any of your resources! Open source projects that use the images are welcome :) Would be nice if you credit me.

If you want to support me use [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/bentix)❤️​.

For some money I will generate the pictures for you (you can send me also your modded clothes) and convert them to a format you decide (recommend .webp).

Contact me for that on Discord **ben.001**

- Take screenshots of every gta clothing (addon clothing included)

## Planned
- Maybe add it for vehicles too

## Known issues
- After the players model switch, the clothing does not appear (please let me know if you have a fix for that)

## Installation
**Dependencies**
- [screenshot-basic](https://github.com/citizenfx/screenshot-basic)
- yarn

### Step 1
Rename the resource from "main-fivem-greenscreener" to "fivem-greenscreener" and put it into your main resources folder.

**Don't use a subfolder like** `resources/[scripts]` **otherwise the script won't work**

## Usage
### Screenshot all clothing
Use the command `/screenshot` and the process for clothing will start.
It will take some time and better don't touch your pc while the script runs.


### Screenshot specific clothing
Use the command `/customscreenshot`, that allows you to screenshot a specific item with optional specific camera settings (format has to be the same as in the config.json).

`/customscreenshot [component] [drawable/all] [props/clothing] [male/female/both] [camerasettings(optional)]`

`/customscreenshot 11 17 clothing male {"fov": 55, "rotation": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 15}, "zPos": 0.26}`

`/customscreenshot 11 all clothing male {"fov": 55, "rotation": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 15}, "zPos": 0.26}`


### Screenshot objects/props
For screenshoting objects you can use the command `/screenshotobject [hash]`.
