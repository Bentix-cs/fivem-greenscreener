# fivem-greenscreener
A small script that allows you to take screenshots of every gta clothing infront of a greenscreen.
You can use them for example in your inventory or a clothing shop.

Greenscreen map from this [repository](https://github.com/Stuyk/altv-greenscreener).

If you want to support me use [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/bentix)❤️​.

For some money I will generate the pictures for you (you can send me also your modded clothes) and convert them to a format you decide (recommend .webp). 
Contact me for that on Discord **ben.001**

## Features
- Take screenshots of every gta clothing (addon clothing included)
- Comprehensible naming of the screenshots for implementing it in your scripts
- Small progress ui
- Almost completely invisible ped
- Config for customizing the camera positions
- Config for enabling cycle through textrue variations
- Greenscreen gets removed automatically (Thanks to @hakanesnn)

## Planned
- Maybe add it for vehicles too

## Installation
**Dependencies**
- [screenshot-basic](https://github.com/citizenfx/screenshot-basic)
- yarn

### Step 1
Rename the resource from "main-fivem-greenscreener" to "fivem-greenscreener" and put it into your main resources folder.

**Don't use a subfolder like** `resources/[scripts]` **otherwise the script won't work**

## Usage
**Turn off your weather and time script.**
Use the command `/screenshot` and the process will start.
It will take some time and better don't touch your pc while the script runs.

You can also use the command `/customscreenshot`, that allows you to screenshot a specific item with optional specific camera settings (format has to be the same as in the config.json).
